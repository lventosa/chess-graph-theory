# Graph theory on a chessboard

Graph theory is the branch of mathematics that studies graphs. A **graph** is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects or, as my Graph theory professor likes to put it, *the subtle art of connecting dots*. 

Graphs can be represented by dots (called vertices) some of which are connected by lines (called edges). Each graph has a matrix form associated, which makes working with graphs much easier. Many real-life problems can be modelled by means of graphs, one of them being a chess game. 

This very simple program computes all the possible destinations of several chess pieces given their permitted moves, according to the rules of the game. It doesn't take into consideration the pawn since it's the only piece that moves differently when it kills another piece. This program is a great tool for a those who are just starting to play chess and still struggle to remember where each piece can get to.

After downloading the folder, compiling and executing the code the program will ask for which piece you wish to know the possible moves and will print the results in a text file created in the same directory.
